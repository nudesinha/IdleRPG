            Children on their own don't do much, but `{prefix}familyevent` can effect your money and crates.
            To have a child, your partner has to be on the server to accept the checkbox.

            There is a 50% chance that you will have a child, and a 50% chance to just *have fun* (if you know what I'm saying) and gain between 10 and 50 lovescore.
            When you have a child, there is a 50% chance for it to be a boy and a 50% chance to be a girl.

            Your partner and you can enter a name for your child once the bot prompts you to. (Do not include `{prefix}`)
            If you fail to choose a name in time, the bot will choose one for you from about 500 pre-picked ones.

            For identification purposes, you cannot have two children with the same name in your family, so make sure to pick a unique one.
